        <h3>The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The "formula", designated in the name, refers to a set of rules, to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (from French, meaning "grand prizes"), which are held worldwide on purpose-built circuits and public roads.</h3>

        <h3>The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships, one for drivers, one for constructors. </h3>
